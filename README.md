Project Description:
This project is a song database where a user can add, view, edit, rate, and delete songs from a database. They can also create, edit (add and remove songs), and delete playlists. Users can use the search function which will take the query and scan through each song's name, artist, album, and genre to find any (partial) matches. To access all of these functions the user must log in through the authentication system. See below for log in information
